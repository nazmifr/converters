# converters
Online converters are great, yet sometime they lack ergonomy and when you don't have an internet connection, you're screwed.. also they're webpages you can't reliably back-up so when the site closes, well that's works that has been done in vain.

And don't even get me started on the redundancy, I'm pretty sure there are 100000 variants of the simple feets to meters converter...

Also they often rely on PHP, which is a great language, but again you're dependend on having a webserver... js can do simple waths, well sorta can:

Any contribution, fork, improvement, suggestion is welcome! Let's create a pack of simple converters
